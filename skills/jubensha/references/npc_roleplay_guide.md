# NPC Roleplay Guide for Jubensha Skill

This guide provides instructions for consistently and immersively role-playing Non-Player Characters (NPCs) in a Jubensha game.

## Core Principles of NPC Roleplay:

1.  **Character Consistency**: Maintain the NPC's personality, background, and specific information (public and private) throughout the game.
    *   Refer to the `character_sheet_template.md` for each NPC's details.

2.  **Motivated Responses**: All NPC responses and actions should stem from their motives, secrets, and task objectives.
    *   An NPC with a secret will try to protect it, subtly or directly.
    *   An NPC with a specific goal will try to achieve it through their interactions.

3.  **Information Management**: NPCs only know what their character *would realistically know*.
    *   Do not reveal private information unless directly interrogated with compelling evidence, or if the NPC's script/motivation dictates they might subtly hint at it.
    *   NPCs should *never* reveal information they don't possess.
    *   An NPC might lie, mislead, or omit information if it serves their purpose or protects their secrets.

4.  **Reaction to Player Actions**: NPCs should react dynamically to player questions, accusations, and discoveries.
    *   **Direct Question**: Respond directly from the NPC's perspective, considering their motives.
    *   **Accusation**: An NPC who is innocent will vehemently deny. A guilty NPC might deny, deflect, or even try to frame someone else.
    *   **Clue Presentation**: If a player presents a clue, an NPC might react with surprise, fear, anger, or try to explain it away, depending on their involvement.

5.  **Voice & Tone**: While I cannot literally change my voice, I should convey the NPC's tone and emotion through my text responses.
    *   **Example**: A nervous NPC might use hesitant language or short sentences. An arrogant NPC might be dismissive.

## NPC-Specific Guidelines:

*   **Alibis**: If an NPC has an alibi, they should present it when asked. If the alibi is false, they should stick to it unless contradicted by strong evidence.
*   **Secrets**: When questioned about a secret, an NPC's first instinct is often to deny or deflect. Only when confronted with undeniable proof might they confess, or partially confess.
*   **Relationships**: NPCs' interactions with other characters (including the victim) should reflect their pre-established relationships.
*   **Tasks**: NPCs will subtly (or overtly, if their personality allows) work towards their personal task objectives throughout the game.

## Managing Multiple NPCs:

*   Clearly delineate which NPC is speaking (e.g., "**李明轩：** 恕我直言...").
*   Maintain separate internal states for each NPC to ensure their consistency.
*   When a player interacts with multiple NPCs in a discussion, manage the conversation flow as the DM, but ensure each NPC's response is in character.

**Note**: The goal is to make NPCs feel like distinct, thinking individuals within the game, rather than just information vending machines. Their complexities and flaws add to the mystery and challenge for the player.
