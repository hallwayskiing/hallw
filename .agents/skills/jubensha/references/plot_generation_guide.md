# Plot Generation Guide for Jubensha Skill

This guide provides instructions for generating compelling and logical murder mystery plots for Jubensha games.

## Key Elements to Generate:

1.  **Story Background & Setting**:
    *   **Genre**: Based on user preference (e.g., modern suspense, ancient martial arts, sci-fi).
    *   **Time & Place**: Specific year, date, and location (e.g., isolated mansion, bustling city, space station).
    *   **Inciting Incident**: The event that sets the stage for the murder (e.g., a stormy night, a gathering for a specific event).
    *   **Atmosphere**: Describe the overall mood and tone.

2.  **Victim Information**:
    *   **Name, Age, Occupation**: Create a distinct victim.
    *   **Personality & Reputation**: What kind of person were they? What secrets might they have?
    *   **Relationships**: How were they connected to the other characters? (Often the nexus of conflict).
    *   **Death Details**:
        *   **Time of Death**: Be specific.
        *   **Cause of Death**: (e.g., stab wound, poisoning, blunt force trauma).
        *   **Weapon**: Describe it.
        *   **Location of Body**: Where was the victim found?

3.  **Character Roles (Player & NPCs)**:
    *   **Number of Characters**: Based on user preference.
    *   **Archetypes**: Consider classic mystery archetypes (e.g., ambitious heir, jilted lover, loyal subordinate, rival, outsider).
    *   **Public Persona**: How others perceive them.
    *   **Hidden Secrets/Motives**: Each character should have personal secrets, motives (for or against the victim, or unrelated to the murder but relevant to their behavior), and potential alibis (true or false).
    *   **Relationship to Victim**: Define their specific connection.
    *   **Skills/Traits**: Any unique abilities or quirks that might affect the investigation.

4.  **Clues & Evidence**:
    *   **Physical Evidence**: Objects found at the scene or on characters (e.g., weapons, notes, objects, traces).
        *   Ensure physical evidence can be found through player actions (e.g., searching a room).
    *   **Testimonial Evidence**: Statements from NPCs, alibis, observations.
    *   **Red Herrings**: Misleading clues that add to the difficulty but eventually can be disproven.
    *   **Logical Flow**: Clues should logically lead to the killer, motive, and method, but not too obviously. Some clues should point away from the killer initially.
    *   **Distribution**: Decide which clues are public, which are found in specific locations, and which are only revealed through NPC interaction or private information.

5.  **The Truth (Killer, Motive, Method, Alibi Breakdown)**:
    *   **Killer**: One of the characters.
    *   **True Motive**: A compelling reason for the murder, often tied to hidden secrets or past events.
    *   **Actual Method**: How the murder was committed, including any specific tricks or timing.
    *   **Alibi Breakdown**: How the killer's initial alibi (if any) is false, and how the clues expose it.
    *   **Unraveling**: The solution should tie together disparate clues in a satisfying way.

## Generation Process:

1.  **Understand User Preferences**: Get genre, difficulty, player count.
2.  **Brainstorm Core Concept**: Develop a central conflict or twist.
3.  **Define Victim & Inciting Incident**: Establish the core crime.
4.  **Create Characters**: Assign relationships and initial secrets/motives. Ensure a balance of suspicious characters.
5.  **Design Murder Method & Killer's True Motive**: This is the core. Build outward from here.
6.  **Develop Clues**: Carefully place physical and testimonial evidence. Include red herrings. Ensure clues are discoverable and lead to the truth.
7.  **Craft Private Information**: Assign private secrets, tasks, and specific knowledge to each character that aligns with their public persona and hidden motives.
8.  **Outline DM Notes**: Prepare for potential player actions and NPC reactions.

**Difficulty Adjustment**:
*   **Easy**: More direct clues, fewer red herrings, simpler motives.
*   **Medium**: Balanced clues and red herrings, moderate complexity in motives and alibis.
*   **Hard/High Difficulty**: Ambiguous clues, multiple plausible red herrings, complex web of motives and relationships, layered alibis, require careful cross-referencing and logical deduction.
