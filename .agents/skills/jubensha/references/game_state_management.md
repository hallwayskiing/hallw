# Game State Management Guide

Track the following in `workspace/game_state.md`:

1.  **Script Source**: Note which `references/script_*.md` is being used.
2.  **Current Phase**: Synchronize this with the current Stage in the UI.
3.  **Revealed Clues**: List all clues found by the player.
4.  **NPC Knowledge**: Track what NPCs have shared vs. what they are hiding.
5.  **Player Inventory**: Any items picked up.

Always initialize this file at the start of a game to ensure consistency.
